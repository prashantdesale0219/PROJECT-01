            class Animal {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
            speak() {
                console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);

            }

            class Dog extends Animal {
            speak() {
                console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
            }
            }

            let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
            dog.speak();

    </script>
<!-- output:- Buddy barks.
     In the above code, the speak() method in the Dog class overrides the speak() 
     method in the Animal class. This means that when the speak() method is called on a Dog object, 
     the Dog class's speak() method is executed instead of the Animal class's speak() method. -->
