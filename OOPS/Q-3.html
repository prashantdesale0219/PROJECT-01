<!--  OUTPUT:- Make: Toyota, Model: Camry, Year: 2020
      In the above code, the `getInfo()` method in the `Car` class overrides the `getInfo()` method in the `Vehicle` class. This means that when the `getInfo()` method is called on an instance of the `Car` class, the `getInfo()` method in the `Car` class is executed instead of the `getInfo` method in the `Vehicle` class.
